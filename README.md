Feynman Diagram Multiplicity Calculator
=======================================


Summary
-------

A simple Python script which prints the multiplicities of all Feynman diagrams with the specified external momenta and internal vertex types, up to the specified perturbation order.

Other settings exist for filtering out only the normal ordered diagrams, fully connected diagrams and diagrams with no vacuum pieces.

Currently only supports real scalar interactions.


Permissions

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/feynman-multiplicity/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
